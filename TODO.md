# TODO

- Try trouble.nvim again.
- Try telescope again and see if still annoying with fix col widths for search & LSP. If so, file issues.
- Try neo-tree over nvim-tree, see if it's really better or not.
- Try new typescript.nvim lsp helper plugin instead of old null-ls one.
- Try mason.nvim again but set install dir manually and update PATH in zshrc.
- Consider more useful statusline, be inspired by own tabline and also [this config](https://github.com/JoosepAlviste/dotfiles/blob/master/config/nvim/lua/j/statusline.lua).
- Try noice.nvim again and see if it's stable and useful enough.
- Simplify bindings boilerplate and implementation.
- Clean out config, remove what I don't use.
