# TODO

- Try telescope again and see if still annoying with fix col widths for search & LSP. If so, file issues.
- Try neo-tree over nvim-tree, see if it's really better or not.
- Consider more useful statusline, be inspired by own tabline and also [this config](https://github.com/JoosepAlviste/dotfiles/blob/master/config/nvim/lua/j/statusline.lua).
- Clean out config, remove what I don't use.
- Try https://github.com/DNLHC/glance.nvim
- Try https://github.com/lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim again, get feel for perf and see if possible to toggle.
- Try https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-move.md
- Try https://github.com/cbochs/grapple.nvim
